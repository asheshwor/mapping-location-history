NepalMaps
---------

This code plots Google location history. These are basically the coordinates collected by Google whenever a Google service is used.

Plots made using ggmap package in R with coordinates parsed from kml files exported from Google location history.

Two sample kml files are added here with time and date removed. Sample output images are presented in sample_output folder.
